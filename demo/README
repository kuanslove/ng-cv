Thanks for your time. This is Kuan, I want to give my best try for the "Software Engineer, Web Interface â€“ Amplero" position as indicated at

With working experience in web development , I got precious opportunity to hone my skill like:
Javascript(Node.js, jQuery, D3.js AgularJS), Java, DB(MongoDB, SQL) Linux.


I have attached my cv and a demo of D3+AngularJS(you probably need a static server to run it, 
like SimpleHTTPServer in python or any basic static server will do, I also commit the demo at(save ur time to run it):

Best,
